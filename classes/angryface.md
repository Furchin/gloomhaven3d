# Angry Face

## Summons
* [Gloomhaven - "Angry Spike Face" Pets](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2855612) - actually quite nice, but incomplete - the Doomstalker has more summons (and this doesn't even cover all the first level summons). Prints super well though, but you'll need to resize the bases to 25mm (simply scale x and y axis).
* See [Circles Summons](/classes/circles.md) (spoilers!) for a link which contains a suitable jackal.

## Accessories
* [Gloomhaven Angry Face Enemy Marker](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4696202) - used to mark minis as doomed
* [Angry Face Doom Marker](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4729112) - haven't printed this one myself
