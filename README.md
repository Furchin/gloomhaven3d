Gloomhaven3D tracks and curates the best 3D printable accessories for the wonderful game that is Gloomhaven.

# Hardware
## 3D Printers
There are so many choices on the market it's easy to get confused. Go with something proven with a lot of community support, since it means if you have a question, you're more likely to have found someone else who's already asked the same question and found an answer.

## Filament
Having bought a ton of different brands, it turns out I'm a fan of hatchbox. It feels a little more solid, more consistent between spools, prints well, and doesn't seem to get as brittle over time as other filaments.

## Software
Prusa Slicer

Fancy supports? Try Meshmixer.

Need to design something yourself? TinkerCad or AutoDesk Fusion 360.

## Painting
Many minis benefit from getting painted. I use a mix of spray paint (when I don't care too much, or if I'm painting 10 monsters) but I use Army Painter Warpaints when I do (mostly for class minis and bosses). I use [Dropper paint bottle holder, stackable](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3200860) to organize and store my paints. 

# Gameplay Improvements
By far the best thing you should print is this [Gloomhaven Player Dashboard Variant](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3625850); it holds the lost and discard piles at a slight angle, which saves space. There's a row along the back to hold your items, some condition icon holders, and the attack modifier deck. It's a great way to keep your game organized. As your characters reach higher levels and have more items (or if you play some item-centric classes) you'll probably want to use your slicer to cut the item holder off so you can print an extra item holder.

Speaking of gameplay, you absolutely need to have [Gloomhaven Helper](http://en.esotericsoftware.com/gloomhaven-helper) installed on your mobile device; it took my group months before we discovered it but once we did we were able to move from playing one scenario per session to two - it's the single biggest improvement you can make to your Gloomhaven experience. Go buy it today.

# Storage Solutions
* [Gloomhaven Character Box](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2994130) to store the characters (spoiler warning: the download contains STL with class names)
* [Gloomhaven Full Storage](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3658149) to store the monster standees, action cards, and stat cards, as well as the terrain hexes, all the round tokens (money, markers, etc). It seems there's a [remix to support sleeved monster cards](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4762529) which I'd definitely check out as I had to remove some of the monster action card walls to make my sleeved cards fit.
* [Gloomhaven Insert (based on Monster All In One Containers)](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3483482) Just print the card holders and dividers. I never got the hex tile storage to print well and I'm using the hex storage from Gloomhaven Full Storage above.
* [Yet Another Mini Storage Solution](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3073819) to organize the minis. It has rows that hold 25mm bases, about 6 minis per row. I spent months storing my minis in ziploc bags -- each time I put them away another hand or sword would break. Learn from my mistake - print this instead.

# Monsters

Standard bases are 25mm diameter disks. You can make one yourself in any 3D program or in PrusaSlicer directly (it's a 25mm diameter cylinder about 2 mm high). If you need one, try the one included in [this Black Imp monster standee](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3016299) - it's got a nice bevelled top.

# Terrain
## Obstacles

# Class-specific Prints
There are some classes for which you can print things; for example, a miniature of a class summon.
